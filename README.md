**Computer Vision Sensing Project in Python and TensorFlow to detect weld defects by Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks**

**Motivation**
Artificial Intelligence has been witnessing a monumental growth in bridging the gap between the capabilities of man and machines. Machine Learning is the latest concept to train the machine models to identify patterns and segregate defective products. Machine learning algorithms are capable to find natural patterns in the data and make predictions and decisions based on the training model. Welding is the most renowned manufacturing process practiced by many industries. There are two types of welding process Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) used in fabrication in the shop. Dye Penetrant Test is a Non-Destructive Testing method performed to check the presence of surface defects like cracks, porosity, blow holes in the work piece welding. Convolutional Neural Network is derived from the network of biological neurons in human brain. Supervised Deep Learning convolutional neural network are used with image processing technique to detect and classify welding defects.

**Purpose**
The need of developing the online weld defects inspection system is mainly because of the following points:
1. As per Material Safety Data Sheet of Dye Penetrant test provided by the supplier, the developer spray used is hazardous to human respiratory system and environment. The developer used is flammable material and can contaminate the surrounding environment or grinding operation.
2. The total testing time for Dye Penetrant Test is about 30-35 minutes which can be drastically reduced by Deep Learning automatic inspection system.
3. The total cost of Non-Destructive Testing is 80% of the manufacturing cost of finished product.
4. After usage, scrapping of waste material developed by the Dye Penetrant Test takes additional cost which will be saved if the automatic inspection technique is adopted.

**Audience**
In almost all major sectors of automobile, steel, aerospace, manufacturing shop uses welding manufacturing technique to produce final product. The machine learning technique applications are widely used in the process of inspection of components. This document is the property of Larsen & Toubro Limited and must not be copied or lent without their permission in writing. It is necessary to automate the inspection process because it produces a valuable benefit to the organization in terms of inspection time, productivity. The intended audience is the manufacturing sector of welding who uses the Dye Penetrant Test on a large scale in an industry. The DPT is mainly used to inspect the welding seams for the presence of any welding defects like cracks, porosity.
